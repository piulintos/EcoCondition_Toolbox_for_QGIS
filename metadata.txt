description=A QGIS plugin for ecosystem condition assessment
about=This plugin contains a set of tools to prepared data for, and assess, the Ecosystem condition of any specific ecosystem type. The ecosystem condition assessment is based on the weighted sum of 6 specific ecosystem states (Physical, Chemical, Compositional, Structural, Functional, Landscape), following the system of environmental accounting developed by the United Nations (https://seea.un.org/ecosystem-accounting). Each state is calculated according to data selected by the user. 

    </br>The different tools allow the user to follow clear steps regarding the correct preparation of the data needed for the assessment. Users are able to:

    <img src="resources/icon_Multicollinearity_mini.png" height="16"/>3. Test data for multicollinearity, 
    <img src="resources/icon_Normalization_mini.png" height="16"/>4. Normalise and invert data (with no-data options),and 
    <img src="resources/icon_EcoCond_mini.png" height="16"/>5. Calculate Ecosystem Condition.
    </br>Once all the data is prepared and verified, the <b>Ecosystem Condition assessment</b> tool allows the user to identify the final layers corresponding to each ecosystem state, doing a final alignment verification. Before proceeding with the calculations, the tool will show default weights attributed to each ecosystem state and each ecosystem state variable. 
    </br>By default, all weights are equally distributed per ecosystem state and layer groups. These weights can be adjusted by the users, allowing them to incorporate specific weights, e.g., derived from stakeholder preferences.
