# EcoCondition Toolbox - A QGIS plugin for ecosystem condition assessment
QGIS plugin with a set of tools to prepare data for, and assess, the Ecosystem condition of any specific ecosystem type. Based on the weighted sum of 6 specific ecosystem states (Physical, Chemical, Compositional, Structural, Functional, Landscape), following the system of environmental accounting developed by the United Nations.
EcoCondition Toolset Plugin for QGIS
‚Ä®Developed as part of the [SELINA project](https://project-selina.eu/), at the [Environmental Management Research Laboratory](https://www.mruni.eu/en/research/mru-laboratories/environmental-management-laboratory/) ([Mykolas Romeris University](https://mruni.eu))

**Status:** üöß beta version

## Overview
The Ecosystem Condition plugin is a tool for QGIS that enables users to calculate ecosystem condition scores using weighted indicators, raster pre-processing, and normalisation steps.
It integrates key GIS functions required for this kind of assessment, including:
* Raster normalisation (with clipping and masking options)
* Euclidean distance calculations
* Multicollinearity checks
* Reclassification and scaling
* Weighted sum of condition indicators

## Key Features
* Modular interface with dedicated tools per step
* Optional use of min/max raster masks
* Support for noData harmonisation and raster alignment
* UX/UI designed for clarity, responsiveness, and reproducibility

## Project Background
This plugin was developed under the scope of the SELINA (Science for Evidence-based and sustainabLe decisIons about NAtural capital) project, with partial support from MAFESUR. It was implemented by Lu√≠s Pinto within the Environmental Management Research Laboratory, Mykolas Romeris University.

‚ö†Ô∏è Although the plugin is licensed openly and the code/UI were fully designed and implemented by the developer, the core indicator aggregation logic (weighted sum) follows specifications from the SELINA team.
Please cite SELINA and MAFESUR appropriately when using this tool in published work.

## Installation
1. Clone or download the plugin repository: git clone [https://github.com/piulintos/EcoCondition_Toolbox_for_QGIS](https://github.com/piulintos/EcoCondition_Toolbox_for_QGIS)
2. Place it in your QGIS plugin directory
3. Activate it from the QGIS Plugin Manager
Tested on QGIS 3.34 and above, Mac and PC environments.

Tested on QGIS 3.34 and above, in both Mac and Windows environment. Intended to work also in Linux.
